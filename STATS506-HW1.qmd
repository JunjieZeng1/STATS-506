# STATS506 Problem Set #1

## Problem 1 - Wine Data

### 1.a

```{r}
# Loading data
dfwine <- read.table("/Users/junjiezeng/Desktop/wine/wine.data", sep = ",")
```

```{r}
# Change column names
names(dfwine) <- c("class", "Alcohol", "Malicacid", "Ash", "Alcalinity_of_ash", "Magnesium", "Total_phenols", "Flavanoids", "Nonflavanoid_phenols", "Proanthocyanins","Color_intensity", "Hue", "OD280_OD315_of_diluted_wines", "Proline")
head(dfwine)
```

### 1.b

The number of wines within each class indeed matches the numbers reported in "wine.names", which are 59, 71, and 48 respectively.

```{r}
# Check the number of wines within each class
nrow(dfwine[dfwine$class == 1, ])
nrow(dfwine[dfwine$class == 2, ])
nrow(dfwine[dfwine$class == 3, ])
```

### 1.c

#### 1.c.1

```{r}


```

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
