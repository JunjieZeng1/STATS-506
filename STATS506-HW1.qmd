dfwine <- read.table("/Users/junjiezeng/Desktop/wine/wine.data", sep = ",")
```

```{r}
# Change column names
names(dfwine) <- c("Class", "Alcohol", "Malic_acid", "Ash", "Alcalinity_of_ash", "Magnesium", "Total_phenols", "Flavanoids", "Nonflavanoid_phenols", "Proanthocyanins","Color_intensity", "Hue", "OD280/OD315_of_diluted_wines", "Proline")

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
